EAAMO Bridges is a multi-institutional initiative using techniques from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from other disciplines, to improve access to opportunity for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities. MD4SG is a community of researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners in various government and non-government organizations, community organizations, and industry working to foster collaborations across disciplines and build research and practice pipelines.

We take an interdisciplinary approach to improve equity and social welfare for marginalized groups. We have worked in problems across a variety of domains such as education, development, fairness and discrimination, housing, healthcare, inequality, and labor markets. Our goal is to facilitate interactions across academia, policy, and industry and to foster collaborations across disciplines. To this end, we organize a monthly online colloquium series, domain-specific working groups, workshops and tutorials, and other activities aimed at exploring new research directions, implementing and deploying solutions, and highlighting exemplary work.

The 1st Workshop on Mechanism Design for Social Good will be taking place at this year's ACM Conference on Economics and Computation at MIT on June 26, 2017. The goal of this workshop is to understand domains where tools from mechanism design have the potential to impact social good. During this year's workshop we will focus on mechanisms that _improve access to opportunity_. We aim to highlight domains that have been relatively unexplored by the EconCS community. We invite paper submissions broadly related to these themes, including theoretical and applied mechanism design work as well as empirical research that suggests future directions for mechanism design in these domains.  
  
Topics of interest for this workshop include but **are not limited to**:

*   allocating low-income housing
*   allocating health insurance funds, managing access to healthcare, and pricing medical treatments
*   work on health insurance markets that highlights market design issues
*   redistributive mechanisms to mitigate economic inequality
*   understanding and increasing intergenerational mobility
*   mitigating unequal economic outcomes in online labor markets
*   detecting existence or causes of exploitative market behavior in online labor markets
*   evaluating students, teachers, or schools
*   design of transportation systems to reverse trends impacting inequality

  
Submissions will be evaluated on the following criteria:

*   Relevance to this workshop and its theme.
*   Novelty of domain.
*   Potential for follow-up work in the EC community: those from other communities who feel they fit this criterion are especially encouraged to submit.

Authors may submit papers that are already under review or accepted in conferences or journals. There will be no published proceedings.  
  
Authors will be asked to submit up to 250 words on EasyChair summarizing their results and relevance to the workshop. In addition, submissions will be accepted as a PDF and may be either working papers or papers that have been published at an established conference or journal. We do not require submissions to be in the EC format. If published, please include citation as to where it was published on the first page. The committee reserves the right not to review all the technical details of submissions.

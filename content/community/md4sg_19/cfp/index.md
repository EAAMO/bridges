The 2nd Workshop on Mechanism Design for Social Good will be taking place at this year's ACM Conference on Economics and Computation at Cornell University on June 22, 2018.  
  
The goal of the workshop is to highlight work where insights from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design have the potential to impact social good. In particular, we will focus on the theme of _improving access to opportunity_. The workshop will feature keynote presentations focusing on economic inequality, online labor markets, bias and discrimination. We encourage submissions addressing these and other domains, such as housing, healthcare, education, civic participation, privacy, and the developing world. The workshop aims to showcase ongoing exemplary work on these topics and to highlight exciting opportunities for future research. Submissions of all types are encouraged, including **theoretical** or **applied** mechanism design work, research that solves algorithmic or optimization problems, and **empirical** research that suggests future directions at this interface and **position** papers.  
  
Topics of interest for this workshop include but **are not limited to**:

*   redistributive mechanisms to improve access to opportunity
*   economic inequality and intergenerational mobility
*   mitigating unequal economic outcomes in online labor markets
*   detecting existence or causes of exploitative market behavior in online labor markets
*   the design of algorithms that mitigate bias and improve diversity
*   allocating low-income housing assistance
*   allocating health insurance funds, managing access to healthcare, and pricing medical treatments
*   design of health insurance markets
*   evaluating students, teachers, or schools
*   design of transportation systems
*   market regulations for data and privacy
*   algorithmic solutions to encourage civic participation
*   evaluating fairness in electoral representation

  
Submissions will be evaluated on the following criteria:

*   Quality of submission as measured by accuracy and clarity of exposition.
*   Relevance to this workshop and its theme of improving access to opportunity.
*   Novelty of domain: we particularly encourage work on applications that have been less explored within the EC community.
*   Potential for follow-up work in the EC community: those from other communities who feel they fit this criterion are especially encouraged to submit.

  
**Submission Instructions:**  
Authors should upload a PDF of their paper to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=md4sg18). There are no specific formatting instructions. Submissions may either be working papers or papers that have been published at an established conference or journal. In the latter case, please include a citation on EasyChair. In addition to the PDF, authors are asked to upload a 200-250 word description onto EasyChair summarizing the results and their relevance to the workshop. There are no length requirements. The committee reserves the right not to review all the technical details of submissions.  
  
Authors may submit papers that are already under review or accepted in conferences or journals. However, papers accepted to this yearï¿½s EC will not be considered for presentation at the workshop. There will be no published proceedings.

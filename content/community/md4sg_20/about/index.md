[Faidra Monachou](https://web.stanford.edu/~monachou) is a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at the Department of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, advised by Itai Ashlagi. Her work focuses on market design and matching theory, and aims at understanding the theoretical foundations of socioeconomic problems that arise in large-scale online markets. She is particularly interested in the study of bias and discrimination in the sharing economy, labor markets and education as well as the role of information design and learning in redesigning non-monetary matching markets. Before coming to Stanford, she graduated from National Technical University of Athens in Greece, where she studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Faidra has been member of the MD4SG initiative since Fall 2018. She has been serving as a co-organizer of the MD4SG Bias, Discrimination, and Fairness working group since Fall 2019.

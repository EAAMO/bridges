# FAccT 2022, curated by MD4SG

Welcome to [FAccT 2022](https://facctconference.org/2022/schedule.html), MD4SG-style. We've curated a list of programming that members of the MD4SG community are involved in.

This MD4SG meetup at FAccT'22' is organized by [Logan Stapleton](https://loganstapleton.com/) and [Corinna Hertweck](https://hcorinna.github.io/) from the MD4SG Community Engagement team.

## MD4SG social @ FAccT'22

We will have two organized MD4SG socials: one in person in Seoul and one online. To signal your interest in these, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdA5tsMpvbNYToAf8FZb9xVoH-h_IHRCamKwcb3QzeGaZNowA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

The online social will take place on the [MD4SG Discord](https://discord.gg/9EqBBJfZBV) on the #facct2022 channel. The Discord channel will be open throughout the conference — we encourage you all to visit and discuss throughout the conference.

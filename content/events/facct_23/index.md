The ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) in Chicago from June 12 to June 15, 2023, amid growing public awareness of AI challenges, specifically focused on the implications of new computational tools on human rights, democracy, equality, and inclusion. During the conference, the MD4SG community organized an informal meeting, offering attendees an opportunity to discuss papers, exchange ideas, and enjoy a communal dinner. This relaxed setting facilitated valuable connections and collaborations among MD4SG community members.

A big thanks to **Corinna Hertweck**, **Thomas Gilbert,** and **Shubham Singh** for making this meeting happen!

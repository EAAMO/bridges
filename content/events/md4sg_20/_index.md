The fourth workshop on **Mechanism Design for Social Good** (MD4SG '20) will be held online on August 17-19, 2020. The goal of the workshop is to highlight work where techniques from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from other disciplines, have the potential to improve access to opportunity for historically underserved and marginalized communities. The workshop will feature keynote presentations, contributed talks, problem pitches and demos, a poster session, and a panel discussion, with a focus on _bridging research and policy_. To this end, participants will include researchers as well as practitioners in various government and non-government organizations and industry.

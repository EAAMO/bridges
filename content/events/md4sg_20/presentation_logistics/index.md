### Auxiliary Information:

In order to help with organization, if you have been selected to present a poster, we ask that you fill out the following [web form](https://forms.gle/qrsqx7hL7JLzrarE9) with auxiliary information **by August 5**.

### Specifications:

We ask that posters consist of 4 slides (total) in pdf format. Furthermore, we strongly encourage authors to create a one minute lightning talk advertising the poster. For the lightning talk, we ask that you upload the talk to YouTube (with visibility set to "unlisted") and send us a link.

### Uploading Material:

Material should be sent to us **by August 10**, via this [web form](https://forms.gle/WNhDdyk2NaK4t9Xa7). The form asks for the following information:

*   Title of poster
*   Abstract (at most 150 words)
*   Authors and affiliations, listing the presenter as contact author
*   A link to a one minute lightning talk advertising the poster. You can [record your lightning talk using Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording) and [upload your lightning talk to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/upload) with visibility set to "unlisted"
*   A poster consisting of four slides with no overlays (in PDF format)
*   Your preferences amongst both poster session timings

The abstract can be based on work published (or accepted for publication) elsewhere. For published papers, please link to the original publication and mention the venue in which the paper was published (or accepted for publication), and the date of publication/acceptance.

### Submissions in Spanish

Due to increased representation from Spanish-speaking institutions, we are accepting (and strongly encouraging) posters and lightning talks in Spanish. The only requisite is that you provide a transcript of your lightning talk to aid in translation.

### Presenter Registration

The presenter must [register](../registration) for MD4SG '20 to present their poster, plus attend the designated online poster session for their work.

### Format:

All posters will be posted in PDF format on the MD4SG '20 webpage. There will be 3 modes of interaction with the audience:

1.  The poster will be posted on the MD4SG website as a 4-slide PDF. You are encouraged to add links to a longer version of the talk and/or the written paper.
2.  Each poster will be accompanied by a recorded short (1 minute) lightning presentation.
3.  **There will be poster sessions on Monday August 17, 3-4pm ET and Wednesday August 19, 1130am - 1230pm ET** . During these sessions, lightning talks will be played to the audience, and then audience members will have the chance to enter limited-size chat rooms to discuss posters in further detail in small groups.

   
In addition, the audience will be encouraged to vote on the best poster presentation. The poster session has been a very successful format of virtual conferences and the organization of MD4SG '20 has optimized for poster sessions to be a focal point for interaction during the conference.

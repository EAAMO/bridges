# NeurIPS 2021, curated by MD4SG

Welcome to [NeurIPS 2021](https://nips.cc/virtual/2021/calendar), MD4SG-style. The schedule for this conference is quite large, so we've curated a list of programming relevant to the MD4SG community, whether for its speaker/organizer/author or topic. Note that all times are in Pacific Standard Time (PST) as is the timezone used by the NeurIPS conference. [(Convert to your timezone.)](https://savvytime.com/converter/ca-los-angeles/dec-6-2021/)

This MD4SG meetup at NeurIPS 2021 is organized by [Jessie Finocchiaro](https://jfinocchiaro.github.io/), [Corinna Hertweck](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/hetw/), and [Lily Xu](https://lily-x.github.io/) from the MD4SG Community Engagement team.

_Many of the events and talks below require a NeurIPS registration to access. All participants have read the [NeurIPS 2021 Code of Conduct](https://neurips.cc/public/CodeOfConduct) and agree to abide by it._

## MD4SG @ NeurIPS Socials

We will have two organized MD4SG socials. These socials are open to all and do not require a NeurIPS registration.

These will take place on the [MD4SG Discord](https://discord.gg/9EqBBJfZBV) on the #neurips2021 channel. The Discord channel will be open throughout the conference — we encourage you all to visit and discuss throughout the conference.

The Mechanism Design for Social Good research group is a multi-institution, interdisciplinary group exploring research directions in various domains where insights from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design can be used to improve access to opportunity.

We keep this website updated with our reading list and detailed discussion notes. The notes are taken by members of the group with some figures and texts taken from the accompanying presentations and papers. The organizers take responsibility for these notes.

## Kira Goldner, University of Washington

- - -

[Kira Goldner](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kgoldner/) is a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by Anna Karlin. Her research focuses on problems in mechanism design, particularly in maximizing revenue in settings that are motivated by practice, such as those where buyer distributions are unknown or buyers are risk-averse. She is also beginning to work on mechanism design within health insurance. She is a 2017 recipient of the Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship and was a 2016 recipient of a Google Anita Borg Scholarship. Kira received her B.A. in Mathematics from Oberlin College and also studied at Budapest Semesters in Mathematics.

## Alon Eden, Tel Aviv University

- - -

[Alon Eden](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~alonarde/) is a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Tel Aviv University. He is advised by Amos Fiat and Michal Feldman. His research interests have focused on algorithmic game theory, and mainly pricing algorithms. In particular, he is interested in finding out whether resources can be allocated efficiently using prices when agents are selfish and arriving online.

Broadly, her academic interests include algorithmic game theory, statistical inference, and theories of justice. Her current time is divided between economics/computer science research, where she studies fairness in algorithmic settings, and philosophy/ethics work, where she considers algorithmic fairness as it relates to notions of procedural, substantive, and distributive justice. Lily graduated from Harvard College in 2015 with an A.B. in Mathematics.

[Irene Lo](http://www.columbia.edu/~iyl2104/) is a Ph.D. student in the IEOR Department at Columbia University. Her main research areas are in the intersection of operations research, computer science and economics. In particular, she is interested in how to optimally allocate scarce resources while incorporating the preferences of strategic agents, and in developing mathematical and algorithmic tools to answer this question. She currently works in matching market design, with a focus on school choice mechanisms. Irene graduated from Princeton University in 2013 with an A.B. in mathematics.

  
  

[<img src="images/manish2.jpg" width="250"/>](images/manish2.jpg)

## Manish Raghavan, Cornell University

- - -

[Manish Raghavan](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~manish/) is a PhD student at Cornell advised by Jon Kleinberg. He studies human decision-making and behavioral biases using techniques from theoretical computer science. He also works on understanding the effects that algorithmic decision-making has on society, focusing on fairness in machine learning. He received his B.S. from UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2016, and he is a recipient of an NSF GRFP fellowship.

The goal of the Summer of Science Program is to support female students from indigenous communities in Mexico as they design and execute research projects aimed at improving their local communities. Applicants to the program are students at various levels of postgraduate education, and they prepare proposals aimed at using techniques from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from the social sciences and humanistic studies to address relevant issues in their communities. Students who are accepted to the program are paired with mentors from MD4SG to work through their projects over the Summer. The end deliverable of this collaboration between mentors and students is a poster presentation which the students give at the Association of Computing Machinery ([ACM](https://www.acm.org/)) Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization ([EAAMO](https://eaamo.org/)).

This year's Summer of Science Program is a partnership between the Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO) research initiative and the National Network of Councils and State Organizations of Science and Technology ([REDNACECYT](https://www.rednacecyt.org/)).

This year, we are excited to welcome 29 students from diverse regions of Mexico, representing a wide range of indigenous communities and languages. Among them are students from states such as Michoacán, San Luis Potosí, Chihuahua, Puebla, and Oaxaca. These students come from indigenous communities that include the Purépecha, Tének, Rarámuri, and Náhuatl, each bringing their unique perspectives and cultural heritage to the program. Their projects cover topics such as environmental conservation, healthcare access, and education in indigenous languages, reflecting their commitment to addressing the challenges faced by their communities.

Newer generations, who are significantly more prepared than previous generations, must assume the risks associated with developing technologies. Educators and parents are asked to be alert, but it is still vital to guide newer generations in the effective use of these technologies.

## REDNACECYT

The National Network of Councils and State Organizations of Science and Technology, A.C., known as REDNACECYT, was established on November 23, 1998, in Guanajuato by Coahuila, Durango, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas.

REDNACECYT has played a significant role in advancing science, technology, and innovation in Mexico. It serves as an organization that unites diverse entities with a shared focus on these areas. It stands out not only for fostering collaboration among entities with distinct objectives related to science, technology, and innovation, but also for actively shaping policies and their application to development in coordination with federal entities.

Initially, REDNACECYT was formed as a platform for discussing programs and initiatives that promote scientific research, technological development, and innovation at the federal level. It facilitates interactions among members and fosters coordination with academia, government, social, and business sectors to shape public policies.

In its early years, REDNACECYT concentrated on national discussions, particularly on federal and state legislation related to science and technology. Over time, it shifted its focus toward federalizing the promotion of scientific and technological activities, maintaining a continuous exchange of best practices and driving the establishment of new councils and similar bodies.

Sinceits inception, REDNACECYT has steadily grown its membership and actively engaged in a wide array of forums. This engagement spans governmental agencies, legislative and executive bodies, federal and state powers, as well as non-governmental organizations.

As REDNACECYT reaches its 20th anniversary, amid a dynamic national and global landscape, it stands as a consolidated force that brings together stakeholders in the scientific, technological, and innovation sectors.

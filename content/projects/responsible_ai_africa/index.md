As a part of the Data and the Global South project, our members [Chinasa Okolo](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~chinasa/), [Kehinde Aruleba](https://le.ac.uk/people/kehinde-aruleba), and [George Obaido](https://georgeobaido.com) wrote a chapter in the Social and Cultural Studies of Robots and AI series about the state of responsible artificial intelligence (AI) in Africa. The project was motivated by the lack of trust, power asymmetries, and deficit narratives that have resulted in an oversight of research for and by researchers in the Global South.

This chapter provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of adopting and implementing AI technologies in Africa. The study explores the concept of responsible AI and its implications for technologies developed and used in Africa. It further analyzes the hurdles for effective adoption and implementation of AI, including digital literacy, the scarcity of local AI talent, and governmental barriers. Additionally, the chapter provides an overview of the AI startup and research landscape in Africa, highlighting both promising organizations and concerning trends. The chapter concludes by envisioning the potential of responsible AI in the African context and provides actionable recommendations for moving toward this goal. The analysis sheds light on the importance of responsible AI for sustainable development in Africa and the opportunities it presents for bridging the digital divide.

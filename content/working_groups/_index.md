EAAMO-Bridges working groups bring together academic researchers from various disciplines to tackle problems in real-world application domains through online working groups. These groups work towards research, implementation, and advocacy projects throughout the year. Notes from the original reading group can be found here.


If you are interested in being involved or pitching problems to these working groups in any of the domains below, please contact the Working Group Organizers at bridges@eaamo.org.

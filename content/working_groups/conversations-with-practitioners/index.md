<!-- The EAAMO-Bridges community aims to bridge research and practice, but many researchers have few opportunities to connect with practitioners. The aim of this working group is to learn from practitioners and contribute our skillsets when collaborating on problems with them. These practitioners work with historically marginalized communities and often have an interest, or expertise, in the ways technology disproportionately affects these communities. 

In previous years, our group has been focused solely on interviewing practitioners. The group meets at the beginning of the year to get to know one another; throughout the year, our group members lead informal interviews with practitioners of their choosing alongside our group (similar to a “fireside chat”). After the interview, we summarise the main insights into a blog post, examples of which can be found below. -->

<!-- For the 2024-2025 year, we aim to build a new structure. In the autumn, we plan to hold multiple conversations with one organization to scope a project with them to which our members can contribute. We have a few different organizations we are in touch with, including [Chayn](https://www.chayn.co/) (gender based violence tech-focused NGO), the EAAMO Social Hackathon organizers (who have access to a Mexican breast cancer dataset with environmental and policy elements), [AlgorithmWatch](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/), and the [Center for Analytical Approaches to Social Innovation](https://www.caasi.pitt.edu/). For the winter/spring 2025, we then will dive into a project we have designed with our partner organization.  -->

We explore co-experimentation with social impact practitioners using participatory methods to ask: *How can AI systems of care be developed for vulnerable and underserved communities — and what is “safe enough”?* Our work bridges generative AI, human–computer interaction, public policy, and the social sciences. In 2025, papers developed by the group were selected for leading conferences including AAAI and APPAM.

*In previous years, the group hosted “Conversations with Practitioners” interviews; an abridged list is linked below.*

**2024–2025.** We partnered with [Chayn](https://chayn.nyc/) — a global nonprofit making healing accessible for all survivors of gender-based violence — to reimagine technology in trauma-informed, multilingual, and feminist ways. Together, we co-developed a feminist GenAI framework as well as a trauma-informed safety evaluation methodology and participatory “test-a-thon” methods for GenAI tools. We also applied NLP and LLM techniques to analyze nearly 8,000 survivor hopes for healing from around the world. This work led to papers accepted at leading conferences such as the *Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence* (AAAI) and the *Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management* (APPAM).

**2025–2026.** Taking this a step further, we are launching *Living Labs* —spaces of co-experimentation and participatory methodology with social impact practitioners and nonprofits. These labs explore what “safe enough” looks like for vulnerable populations; how AI can be used practically for good while minimizing harm; and how to equip practitioners with AI literacy to use these systems with discernment. We also design practical toolkits for academic–nonprofit partnerships and build a public knowledge commons on AI and GenAI use cases for the social impact sector.

We bring together trauma-informed researchers and practitioners passionate about ethical tech and AI for good. This work is intentionally interdisciplinary, welcoming students and academic researchers from computer science, HCI, public policy, social sciences, linguistics, psychology, social work, and beyond.

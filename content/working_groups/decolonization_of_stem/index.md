title: "Decolonization of STEM Curriculum"
date: 2024-08-20
draft: false
description: "We seek through this working group to develop a set of curricula for undergraduate students that will be developed and distributed through EAAMO Bridges. Our main goals are to develop these courses around Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization that intersect various fields (i.e., healthcare, art, and law) from an approach that uplifts and acknowledges the efforts of marginalized folks in these spaces."
summary: "We seek to develop a set of curricula for undergraduate students in courses around Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization that intersect various fields (i.e., healthcare, art, and law) with an idea to uplift and acknowledge the efforts of marginalized folks in these spaces while empowering students to engage with these fields in a way that deconstructs and resists colonial structures and ideologies."

**Goals:** We seek through this working group to develop a set of curricula for undergraduate students that will be developed and distributed through EAAMO Bridges. Our main goals are to develop these courses around Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization that intersect various fields (i.e., healthcare, art, and law) from an approach that uplifts and acknowledges the efforts of marginalized folks in these spaces.

**Why is this needed?** The reason for this is that institutions continue to limit our students by forcing them into a narrow focus on STEM that ultimately perpetuates the systems of power and oppression many marginalized people face. Our approach will prioritize centering the perspectives, knowledge, and experiences of historically marginalized groups and actively working to deconstruct and resist colonial structures and ideologies in STEM.

Activities we will engage in are: *curriculum design, curriculum building, access and accessible design, student development, career readiness in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization, and student support towards the goals weâ€™ve mentioned earlier*.
